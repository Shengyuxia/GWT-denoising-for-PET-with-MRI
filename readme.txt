INSTALLATION:
- This code requires to have the Graph Signal Processing Toolbox(GSP box) installed, which 
can be freely downloaded from https://epfl-lts2.github.io/gspbox-html/
- Once these packages have their corresponding mex files compiled 
(check their instructions for further details), make sure they are added in
the Matlab path.

USAGE:
The main function is PhantomDenoise.m, which performs graph filtering method in Phantom (refer to the referenced paper for more details).
